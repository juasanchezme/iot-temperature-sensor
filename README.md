# 🌲 Forest Fire Early Warning System 🔥

## 📜 Justification
Forest fires are primarily influenced by human activities rather than spontaneous natural events. In order to prevent and alert authorities about potential forest fires, it is imperative to develop an early warning system. This system aims to minimize environmental and ecosystem losses by providing real-time monitoring and control to district and private organizations.

The proposed solution involves in-situ data collection through interconnected sensors that constantly measure temperature and other environmental conditions. This data is then transmitted via mobile devices to alert the responsible entities, allowing for immediate action. 

The implementation of this system is designed to be energy-efficient and capable of operating in remote locations with minimal human intervention.

## 🎯 Objectives
- **Early Detection**: 🔔 Alert about potential forest fires before they escalate.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: 🕒 Provide continuous data on environmental conditions.
- **Sustainability**: 🌞 Operate using renewable energy sources.
- **Low-Cost Solution**: 💰 Utilize affordable and accessible components for wide-scale deployment.

## 🏗️ System Architecture
The system is composed of several sensors and hardware components, powered by renewable energy, that continuously monitor temperature, humidity, and gas levels. Data is transmitted through LoRa technology to a central node, where it is processed and sent to mobile devices for real-time alerts. 

The architecture includes:
1. **Sensor Nodes**: 📡 Collect environmental data.
2. **Data Transmission**: 🚀 Via LoRa technology to a central server.
3. **Central Processing**: 🧠 Data is analyzed, and alerts are generated.
4. **Mobile Notifications**: 📱 Authorities and users are notified of any potential fire risks.
